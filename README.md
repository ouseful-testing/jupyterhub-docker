# JupyterHub deployment for use On Reclaim.Cloud

This is a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) deployment based on
Docker originally inspired by [`defeo/jupyterhub-docker`](https://github.com/defeo/jupyterhub-docker) (described [here](https://opendreamkit.org/2018/10/17/jupyterhub-docker/)), partially funded by the EU H2020 project [OpenDreamKit](https://opendreamkit.org/), and as used at the [Université de
Versailles](https://jupyter.ens.uvsq.fr/).

## Features

- Containerized single user Jupyter servers, using
  [DockerSpawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner);
- first use authenticator;
- User data persistence;

The HTTPs reverse-proxy as used in the original has been removed with the intention that https and load reverse-proxy support are provided by the Jelastic platfrom on the host.
